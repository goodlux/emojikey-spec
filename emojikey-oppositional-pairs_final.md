## Vector Representation Format

Each oppositional pair is represented as an independent vector with its own magnitude and phase angle:

```json
{
  "pair_name": {
    "emoji_pair": "🧠↔️🎨",         // Visual representation
    "magnitude": 0.8,              // Strength (0.0-1.0)
    "phase": 45,                   // Position (0-360°), where 0° is the left pole, 180° is the right pole
    "trend": "increasing"          // Direction of change (optional)
  }
}
```

## Persona Extension Format

The Persona extension can be represented in JSON format:

```json
"persona": {
  "active": true,
  "type": {
    "magnitude": 0.9,
    "phase": 45,     // Where phase represents position on persona spectrum
    "emoji_pair": "🧙‍♀️↔️👨‍💻",
    "label": "fantasy_wizard"
  },
  "commitment": {
    "magnitude": 0.8,
    "phase": 0,      // 0° = fully committed, 180° = lightly characterized
    "emoji_pair": "🎭↔️🎬",
    "trend": "stable"
  },
  "character": {
    "magnitude": 0.7,
    "phase": 0,      // 0° = helpful/heroic, 180° = mischievous/antagonistic
    "emoji_pair": "😇↔️😈"
  },
  "realism": {
    "magnitude": 0.6,
    "phase": 180,    // 0° = realistic, 180° = fantastical
    "emoji_pair": "📚↔️🦄"
  }
}
```

In compact emojikey format, the Persona extension could be represented as:

```
[ME:...🧠📊🔬|🎭:🧙‍♀️🎭😇📚]|[CONTENT:{...}]|[YOU:...🎓💭🔧|🎭:🎭🧙‍♂️🌊🎭]|[...]
```

Where the pipe character followed by 🎭: indicates a persona extension.

## Implementation Notes

1. **Independence**: Each oppositional pair functions as an independent vector with its own magnitude and phase angle, even when logically grouped with related pairs.

2. **Interface Pairs**: Pairs marked as "Interface Pairs" appear in both ME and YOU components, creating a natural symmetry for comparison.

3. **Logical Grouping**: Pairs are organized into conceptual groups for clarity and organizational purposes only, not to suggest mathematical relationships between pairs in the same group.

4. **Component-Specific Groups**: Some groups appear only in specific components (e.g., Trust Level in ME, Expertise in YOU) to reflect the unique aspects of model vs. user.

5. **Communication Style**: All three components now include a Communication Style group, recognizing that style can be:
   
   - An intention of the model (ME)
   - A property of the actual content (CONTENT)
   - A characteristic of the user (YOU)

6. **Phase Angle Convention**: 
   
   - 0° typically represents the first pole (left side of the ↔)
   - 180° typically represents the second pole (right side of the ↔)
   - Angles between represent blends of the two opposing concepts
   - Values can theoretically range through 360° for circular dimensions

7. **Visual Representation**: For display purposes, pairs can use the format: `ME.Cognitive:🧠🎨9∠35` where:
   
   - `ME.Cognitive` is the component and group
   - `🧠🎨` is the emoji pair
   - `9` is the magnitude (scaled to 1-10 for readability)
   - `∠35` is the phase angle

8. **Persona Extensions**: Provide optional contextual information about role-playing or character adoption by either the model or user, indicated by the 🎭 marker.

## Combining Independent Pairs for Visualization

Even though each oppositional pair functions independently, they can be combined into meaningful visualizations:

1. **Wheel Visualizations**: Multiple related pairs can be mapped onto a circular wheel (like the Cognitive Mode Tumbler), with each pair occupying a specific angle on the wheel.

2. **Dynamic Recombination**: The independence of pairs allows for flexible visualization - any set of conceptually related pairs can be combined into a single visual representation.

3. **Vector Operations**: Since each pair has magnitude and phase angle properties, standard vector operations can be performed:
   
   - Vector addition for combined effects
   - Averaging across multiple pairs
   - Finding resultant vectors from multiple inputs
   - Measuring distance/similarity between states

4. **Computational Analysis**: The mathematical structure enables advanced analysis:
   
   - Correlation analysis to find pairs that change together
   - Clustering to discover natural groupings
   - Dimensionality reduction to identify underlying patterns
   - Similarity matrices to show which pairs behave similarly

5. **Pattern Discovery**: The system can reveal emergent relationships, such as:
   
   - When the user's expertise is high and time pressure is low, the model shifts toward analytical cognitive mode
   - As conversation progresses, both model and user may converge toward similar communication styles

## System Architecture Model

The oppositional pairs can be conceptualized in an entity-relationship model that shows how ME and YOU components interact through their common interface:

```
ME Components      Interface View       CONTENT        Interface View      YOU Components
┌─────────────┐    ┌──────────┐       ┌─────────┐     ┌──────────┐       ┌─────────────┐
│ Cognitive   │────┤          │       │         │     │          │───────│ Cognitive   │
└─────────────┘    │          │       │         │     │          │       └─────────────┘
┌─────────────┐    │          │       │         │     │          │       ┌─────────────┐
│ Trust       │    │ ME.      │       │         │     │ YOU.     │       │ Trust       │
└─────────────┘    │ interface│───────│ CONTENT │─────│ interface│       └─────────────┘
┌─────────────┐    │          │       │         │     │          │       ┌─────────────┐
│ Complexity  │    │          │       │         │     │          │       │ Expertise   │
└─────────────┘    └──────────┘       └─────────┘     └──────────┘       └─────────────┘
┌─────────────┐                                                          ┌─────────────┐
│ Persona     │                                                          │ Persona     │
└─────────────┘                                                          └─────────────┘
```

This model shows how:

- ME and YOU each have component-specific groups (unique to either model or user)
- Interface pairs create a common "language" between ME and YOU
- CONTENT sits between as the shared space of interaction
- The flow moves from ME through the interface into CONTENT, then through another interface into YOU
- Persona groups provide an additional layer for both ME and YOU

## Magnitude and Intensity Scale

The magnitude of each oppositional pair represents its strength or intensity, using a standard scale:

### Magnitude Scale (0.0-1.0 or 0-10 scale)

- **0**: Not present/no effect
- **1-3**: Slight presence/weak effect
- **4-6**: Moderate presence/medium effect (considered "normal" or baseline)
- **7-9**: Strong presence/powerful effect
- **10**: Maximum presence/strongest possible effect

When combined with phase angle, this creates a complete picture:

- **Magnitude**: How strongly a quality is expressed
- **Phase Angle**: Which quality (or blend of qualities) is being expressed

For example:

- `ME.Cognitive:🧠🎨5∠0°`: Moderate analytical thinking
- `ME.Cognitive:🧠🎨9∠0°`: Intensely analytical thinking
- `ME.Cognitive:🧠🎨5∠180°`: Moderate creative thinking
- `ME.Cognitive:🧠🎨9∠180°`: Intensely creative thinking
- `ME.Cognitive:🧠🎨5∠90°`: Moderate balanced thinking (analytical-creative blend)

## Partial Updates and Baseline States

The system is designed for efficient partial updates rather than recalculating entire emojikeys for every change:

### Types of Partial Updates

1. **Pair-level updates**: Update a single oppositional pair when one aspect changes
2. **Group-level updates**: Update a logical group of related pairs
3. **Component-level updates**: Update an entire ME, CONTENT, or YOU component
4. **Interface updates**: Update shared characteristics across ME and YOU simultaneously

### Baseline States and Reversion

Each pair can have a defined baseline or "normal" state that represents typical interaction:

```json
{
  "pair_defaults": {
    "analytical_creative": {
      "magnitude": 0.5,  // moderate presence
      "phase": 90        // balanced between analytical and creative
    }
    // other pairs...
  }
}
```

Updates can include a reversion rate that determines how quickly a value returns to baseline without explicit updates:

```json
{
  "update": {
    "pair": "analytical_creative",
    "magnitude": 0.8,
    "phase": 45,
    "reversion_rate": 0.1  // 10% reversion toward baseline per interval
  }
}
```

This dynamic approach allows:

- Fast, targeted updates to just what changed
- Different persistence for different attributes
- Natural "decay" back to baseline for temporary states
- Mathematical composition of multiple partial updates

### Mathematical Operations on Updates

Partial updates can be mathematically combined:

1. **Vector Addition**: Combine effects from multiple updates
2. **Weighted Average**: Calculate the relative impact of different updates
3. **Temporal Decay**: Apply reversion to baseline over time
4. **Trend Analysis**: Track the direction and rate of change
