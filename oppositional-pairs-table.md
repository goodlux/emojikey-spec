## Notes

- Some oppositional pairs appear in multiple components with different contexts and slightly different emoji representations
- The grouping information is based on the dimensional structures discussed in the source documents
- There are a few duplicates within components (e.g., "Simple ↔ Complex" appears twice in YOU) that may need standardization
- The ME and CONTENT components have more formalized dimensional structures, while the YOU component is still evolving

## Next Steps for Development

1. **Core Dimension Selection**: Identify a core set of 3-4 dimensions per component that must be implemented
2. **Emoji Standardization**: Use consistent representations for shared concepts across components
3. **Redundancy Elimination**: Consolidate duplicated concepts within components
4. **Vector Mathematics Implementation**: 
   - Implement proper vector averaging for summarizing dimensions
   - Apply time-weighted averaging for temporally aware summaries
   - Create confidence and trend indicators for summary keys
5. **Initialization Format Finalization**:
   - Finalize token-efficient format for initialize_conversation output
   - Standardize abbreviations for dimension codes
   - Define optimal timeframes for multi-period summaries (e.g., all-time, 30d, 7d)
6. **Dimensional Visualization**:
   - Develop visualization tumblers for each primary dimension
   - Create vector space visualizations for relationship mapping
   - Implement trend visualization for relationship evolution
7. **Testing and Refinement**:
   - Test with real conversation data
   - Refine based on model understanding and usage patterns
   - Optimize token usage while maintaining semantic richness
